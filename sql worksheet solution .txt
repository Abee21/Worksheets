11-   Data warehousing is the process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide a meaningful business insights.
      It is typically used to connect and analyze business data from hetrogeneous sources.

12-           OLAP                                                OLTP

        1   It is used for data analysis.                        1- It is used to manage vary large number of online short transactions.
        2   It use data warehouses.                              2- It uses traditional DBMS.
        3   It manage all insert,udate and delete transaction.   3- It is mainly used for data readin.
        4   Processing time slow.                                4 - Processing time very fast.
        5   Table in OLAP Database are not normalized.           5- Table in OLTP databases are normalized.

13- Characteristics of Data warehouse-

    Subject-oriented – A data warehouse is always a subject oriented as it delivers information about a theme instead of organization’s current                        operations. 
                       It can be achieved on specific theme. That means the data warehousing process is proposed to handle with a specific theme                             which is more defined.                        
     Integrated –   It is somewhere same as subject orientation which is made in a reliable format. Integration means founding a shared entity to scale the all similar data from the different databases. The data also required to be resided into various data warehouse in shared and generally granted manner.
    
     Time-Variant – 
In this data is maintained via different intervals of time such as weekly, monthly, or annually etc. It founds various time limit which are structured between the large datasets and are held in online transaction process (OLTP). The time limits for data warehouse is wide-ranged than that of operational systems. The data resided in data warehouse is predictable with a specific interval of time and delivers information from the historical perspective. It comprises elements of time explicitly or implicitly. Another feature of time-variance is that once data is stored in the data warehouse then it cannot be modified, alter, or updated.
   
     Non-Volatile –  
As the name defines the data resided in data warehouse is permanent. It also means that data is not erased or deleted when new data is inserted.      It includes the mammoth quantity of data that is inserted into modification between the selected quantity on logical business. It evaluates the       analysis within the technologies of warehouse.




14- 
Star schema is the fundamental schema among the data mart schema. This schema is widely used to develop or build a data warehouse and dimensional data marts.It includes one or more fact tables indexing any number of dimensional tables. The star schema is a necessary case of the snowflake        schema. It is also efficient for handling basic queries.

15-               
  SETL is a high-level programming language that's based on the mathematical theory of sets.It is an interpreted language with a syntax that is         resembles C and in many cases similar to Perl. In SETL every statement is terminated by a semicolon. Variable names are case-insensitive and are      automatically determined by their last assignment.
