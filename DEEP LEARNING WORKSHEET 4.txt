12- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize and classify features in images for computer vision.
  Role of CNN -
  1-A convolution tool that splits the various features of the image for analysis.
  2-A fully connected layer that uses the output of the convolution layer to predict the best description for the image.

13-Average Pooling: Calculate the average value for each patch on the feature map.
Maximum Pooling (or Max Pooling): Calculate the maximum value for each patch of the feature map.

14-Padding-It refers to the amount of pixels added to an image when it is being processed by the kernel of a CNN.

15-CNNs have an input layer, and output layer, and hidden layers. The hidden layers usually consist of convolutional layers, ReLU layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input. This passes the information on to the next layer.
Pooling combines the outputs of clusters of neurons into a single neuron in the next layer.
Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer.
