10-R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.
The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. The adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance.
11-It is a function that measures the performance of a Machine Learning model for given data. Cost Function quantifies the error between predicted values and expected values and presents it in the form of a single real number.
12-The various metrics used to evaluate the results of the prediction are :
Mean Squared Error(MSE)
Root-Mean-Squared-Error(RMSE).
Mean-Absolute-Error(MAE).
R² or Coefficient of Determination.
Adjusted R²
